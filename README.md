# Raccoons
Try It Out is Team “Definitely not 4 raccoons in a trench coat”'s project for 2020 Smarthack Hackathon.


Try It Out is an Android app enhancing the online experience to bring it closer to IRL shopping, while also optimizing the latter.
Our goal with this app was to improve the sensory experience of online shopping while maintaining the comfort and safety of online shopping.
Returns aren't a rare occurrence in brick and mortar shopping but their rates are much higher in the online domain and with the recent pandemic those rates have skyrocketed.
Using our preview feature we aim to put a dent in these climbing return rates and save both businesses and consumers time and money.
